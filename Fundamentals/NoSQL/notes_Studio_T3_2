## To insert new record 
db.data.insertOne({
_id : 99 ,
name : "noha" , 
track : "AI"
})


## The output after the first insertion 
## acknowledged: true means the operatiion has been done successfully 
## insertedId: 99 is the id of the record we entered
{ acknowledged: true, insertedId: 99 }


## if I did not write an id it will return an id as an ObjectId()


## 
db.student.insertOne({
_id : 99 ,
name : "noha" , 
track : "AI"
})


#### 
// TO show the Noha data 
db.student.find({_id:99})


// Delete the record of noha
db.student.deleteOne({ _id : 99 })


## same as the insert output but for the delete
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1.0 }








---------------------------------------------------------
Insert in NoSQL has 3 options :
- insertOne -> TO insert a document
- insertMany -> TO insert many documents 
- insert -> for insert a document and an ordered option


Delete has the same options

if you deleted a document using a where condition that valid for many rows it will delete the first one
