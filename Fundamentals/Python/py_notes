super(child , self ) ///////////////////////// if there is not parent I CAN  go to the object 
it mpves to the first direct parent

I can get benifits of the multiple inheretance by the functionalities but the variables and constructors it will move from the child to direct father and so on 



A task to do :

__init__ is a special method 




private attributee -> scope binding -> print(emp.__dict__)
